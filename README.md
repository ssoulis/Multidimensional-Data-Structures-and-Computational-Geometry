# Multidimensional-Data-Structures-and-Computational-Geometry


PURPOSE OF PROJECT:

Development of geometric multidimensional structures:

1. 3D R-trees for Spatio-Temporal Queries on NW trajectories in the plane: Implement queries on trajectories of moving objects (trajectory queries) in the plane, making use of 3D R-trees indexing points of the form (x,y,t).

2. Interval trees and Segment trees for interval and stabbing queries respectively. Performance study of basic operations on the two structures. 

3. Convex Hull: Implementation of convex hulls in 2 dimensions.

4. Line Segment Intersection: implementation of algorithms for finding intersections between rectilinear segments in the plane resulting from the "boundaries" of polygonal regions e.g. in map overlay applications in GIS etc.


Prerequisite Knowledge: Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity, Databases, Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming.

VERSION or DATE: SUMMER 2023
